# Final Exam

## Steps for you:
* Configure a Gitlab Server on DigitalOcean
* Add my ssh key to your server
* Add your ssh key to your server
* Create a repository on your computer. Make 10 commits. Push your repo to gitlab.
* Send me the url of the repo so I can clone it. ( i.e. submit on blackboard / email me something like `git@134.122.24.11:root/myfirstbashproject.git` )

## Steps for me:
* Clone the repo
* Check the output of `git log` for 10 commits.
* Try to push a commit

## Grading Criteria

If I can clone a repo, it has 10 commits, and I can push to your server you get a 100. If any of that doesn't work I'll have to dream up some partial credit which will vary with my mood. It's best if you just do everything correctly.

Due by 11:59PM of Wednesday, June 17th.

Please get this in and correct so I can give you an A and I can get all my grading paperwork done on time.
