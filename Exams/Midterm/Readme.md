# Midterm!

## Part 1 - Do Over Spring Break
To see the exam in action, type:

```
bash exam.sh
```

and answer the questions. 

Or you can make the file executable and run the exam that way:

```
chmod 755 exam.sh
./exam.sh
```

You will see a file YourName/examQuestions.sh

The file contains 4 functions, `question1()`, `question2()`, `question3()` and
`run_your_questions()`. Using the file MelvynDrag/examQuestions.sh as a
template, write three multiple choice questions that have to do with Linux. If
the user enters the correct answer you should echo "right" into the
$ANSWER\_FILE. If the user enters a wrong answer you should echo "wrong". If the
user enters something invalid, you should ask the user for correct input.

*All you have to do is modify the three questions!* Don't do anything else or
you might break this script that I've carefully put together.

Your code must work! This is time sensitive, and the whole
class needs you to make these good questions on time so I have a few days to
polish it and work out any kinks.

## Part 2 
Pull changes from my repo into your fork, then run the exam.sh script and answer all the questions correctly.
